<h3> <!-- Opens a section explaining how social media works -->
    Social media works by letting people create accounts where they can share photos, videos, and messages with others. 
    Once someone signs up, they can follow or add friends to see what they post. 
    Most social media apps use something called an algorithm, which means the app tries to show you posts that it thinks youll like based on what youve watched or liked before. 
    This is why your feed is always changing and full of things that interest you. 
    People can like, comment, or share posts, which helps them spread quickly. 
    Social media also sends notifications to remind you to check your messages or see what your friends are doing. 
    Behind the scenes, companies use the platform to advertise, and they often collect data to show users more targeted content and ads.

<h4>What are Algorithms and how do they affect what users see on Social Media</h4> <!-- Creates a subheading about algorithms -->

<h5> <!-- Opens a section explaining algorithms -->
    Algorithms are sets of rules or instructions that social media platforms use to decide what content to show each user. 
    Instead of showing every post in the order it was shared, platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube use algorithms to sort and recommend posts based on what they think youll like the most. 
    These decisions are made by tracking what you watch, like, comment on, share, or how long you spend looking at certain content.

<h6> <!-- Opens a section providing an example of how algorithms work -->
    For example, if you often watch funny videos or follow cooking pages, the algorithm will start showing you more of that type of content. 
    While this can make your feed more interesting and personal, it also means you might miss out on posts from friends or new topics, since the algorithm is focused on keeping you engaged. 
    This is why everyone's social media feed looks different, even if they follow the same accounts.
