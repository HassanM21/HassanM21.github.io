<h1>How Has Social Media Changed the Way We Communicate?</h1> <!-- Creates a main heading for the first question -->

<h2> <!-- Opens a section explaining how social media has changed communication -->
    Social media has completely changed how people communicate in everyday life. 
    Instead of only talking in person or through phone calls, people now send messages, pictures, and videos instantly through apps like WhatsApp, Snapchat, or Instagram. 
    Emojis, GIFs, and memes have also become a big part of how we express feelings and ideas. 
    Communication is now faster, more visual, and more public. People can share opinions with a large audience in seconds, and conversations often happen in comments or group chats instead of face-to-face. 
    Social media also allows people from different countries to connect, making communication more global than ever before.

<h3>How Does Social Media Affect Our Relationships?</h3> <!-- Creates a subheading for the second question -->

<h4> <!-- Opens a section explaining how social media affects relationships -->
    Social media can both strengthen and strain relationships. On the positive side, it helps people stay connected across distances, making it easier to share updates and maintain friendships. 
    However, it can also lead to misunderstandings, jealousy, or insecurity, as people compare their lives to others' posts. 
    Spending too much time online may also reduce face-to-face interaction, weakening personal connections. Ultimately, how social media affects relationships depends on how it's used. Mindful use can enhance connections, while misuse can create tension.

<h5>Does Social Media Negatively Impact Wellbeing?</h5> <!-- Creates a subheading for the third question -->

<h6> <!-- Opens a section explaining how social media impacts wellbeing -->
    Social media can negatively impact wellbeing, especially when used too often or in unhealthy ways. 
    Spending too much time scrolling can lead to feelings of anxiety, loneliness, or low self-esteemâ€”especially if people compare themselves to others online. 
    Seeing only the highlights of other people's lives can make users feel like they're not doing enough or not good enough. 
    It can also affect sleep and concentration. However, social media doesn't affect everyone the same way. 
    For some, it can be a positive space for support and connection. The key is finding a healthy balance and being mindful of how it makes you feel.
