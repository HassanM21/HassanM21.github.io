<h4> <!-- Opens a section with detailed information about social media -->
    Social media refers to digital platforms and technologies that enable users to create, share, and interact with content and with each other in real time. 
    These platforms include websites and apps like Instagram, TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and LinkedIn, each serving different purposes, 
    from personal connection and entertainment to professional networking and activism. 
    What distinguishes social media from other forms of digital communication is its interactive nature and emphasis on user-generated content, 
    where anyone can be both a consumer and a creator. 
    Over time, social media has become a central part of daily life, influencing how people communicate, express themselves, and engage with the world around them.
